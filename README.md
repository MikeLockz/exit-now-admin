Don't you hate getting stuck in traffic for hours on your way back from the mountains?

Exit-Now was built to help aleviate those traffic jams by enticing drivers to get off the roads during times of peak congestion and rather delaying their driving until the traffic lightens up.

"How" do you ask?

We do this by alerting drivers to expected high traffic conditions and aditionally offering drivers with coupon saving incentives to exit the highway and patrionage nearby business establishments.
